# pyTreeLearn 0.1.0
Python Deep Learning Library for Tree-Structured Learning based on PyTorch and DGL frameworks.

## Overview
The Library is developed in modules that can be divided into:

- [Tree Encoders](treeLSTM/)
- [Tree Decoders](TreeDecoder/)
- [Tree-to-Tree Transducers](Tree2Tree/)

## Dependencies & Requirements
It follows the list of the requirements to run the code (in brackets the version used during tests):

- Python 3.x (3.7.3)  core
- Pytorch (1.4.0) model core (structure and computation)
- DGL (0.4.2) tree representation, computational flow optimization, batching
- NLTK (3.4.1)  auxiliary data loading functions
- NumPy (1.16.3)  auxiliary functions
- tqdm (4.32.1) prettyprint progressbar
