# Tree Decoders (***---Under test---***)
Decoders generate trees starting form a fixed sized encoding vector, for example generated by one the [Tree Encoders](../treeLSTM/).

The library provides three main types of decoders:

- **Nary TreeDecoder:** each node one-shot generates all its children independently
- **DoubleRNN TreeDecoder:** each node generates only its first child and next sibling
- **EncDec TreeDecoder:** each node generates the list of children (sequential dependency among children)
